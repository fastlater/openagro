## OpenAgro
> This is an open source project for manage farms in Brazil and the main goal is to be a easy to use tool, effective in the field and help farmers understand their companies better and do not cost anything.

In this project I'll be using a framework called "Adianti Framework". It has a lot of features that make Your development easier and focused in business apps creation. To speed up the creation of this kind of application, it provides a collection of visual components ready to help you build forms and datagrids. This way, the developer may focus on the business rules, not in the interface building.
